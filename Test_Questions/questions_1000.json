Question 10: ### Response: \"Why are Member States required to avoid undue duplication of control over settlement systems?\" The student must understand and explain why controlling the operation, accessibility, and compliance of financial institutions is important in terms of efficient functioning and security, especially related to these rules. The answer should provide a clear understanding without assuming any prior knowledge about this topic. Question 11: ### Response: \"Why are Member States not restricted by these regulations from the use of those facilities for the clearing and settlement of transactions on a trading venue?\" The question asks why certain restrictions aren't applied, while others are.

Conditional guarantees prescribing conditions under which the guarantor may not be obliged to perform may be recognised subject to permission of the competent authorities. The assignment criteria shall adequately address any potential reduction in the risk mitigation effect. 2.   An institution shall have clearly specified criteria for adjusting grades, pools or LGD estimates, and, in the case of retail and eligible purchased receivables, the process of allocating exposures to grades or pools, to reflect the impact of guarantees for the calculation of risk weighted exposure amounts. These criteria shall comply with the requirements set out in Articles 171, 172 and 173. The criteria shall be plausible and intuitive. They shall address the guarantor's ability and willingness to perform under the guarantee, the likely timing of any payments from the guarantor, the degree to which the guarantor's ability to perform under the guarantee is correlated with the obligor's ability to repay, and the extent to which residual risk to the obligor remains. 3.   The requirements for guarantees in this Article shall apply also for single-name credit derivatives. In relation to a mismatch between the underlying obligation and the reference obligation of the credit derivative or the obligation used for determining whether a credit event has occurred, the requirements set out under Article 216(2) shall apply. For retail exposures and eligible purchased receivables, this paragraph applies to the process of allocating exposures to grades or pools. The criteria shall address the payout structure of the credit derivative and conservatively assess the impact this has on the level and timing of recoveries. The institution shall consider the extent to which other forms of residual risk remain. 4.   The requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 3 shall not apply for guarantees provided by institutions, central governments and central banks, and corporate entities which meet the requirements laid down in Article 201(1)(g) if the institution has received permission to apply the Standardised Approach for exposures to such entities pursuant to Articles 148 and 150. In this case the requirements of Chapter 4 shall apply. 5.   For retail guarantees, the requirements set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall also apply to the assignment of exposures to grades or pools, and the estimation of PD. 6.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions according to which competent authorities may permit conditional guarantees to be recognised. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2014.

The authority can choose between deferring the publication until all reasons for non-publication cease, publishing it anonymously, or refraining from publishing it entirely. The latter two options should comply with national law and not jeopardize financial stability. Question 4: What happens if a decision is published anonymously? If the authority decides to publish on an anonymous basis, the relevant data may be delayed in publication for one of two reasons - either due to appeals or because of potential risks related to personal information protection.

This allows investment firms to choose to apply the standardised approach, the alternative standardised approach under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, or the option to use internal models, once those latter two approaches become applicable to credit institutions not only for reporting purposes but also for own funds requirements purposes. In the meantime, and at least during the five years after the date of application of this Regulation, investment firms should apply the market risk framework (standardised approach or, if applicable, internal models) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for the purpose of calculating their K‐NPR. If the provisions set out in Chapters 1a and 1b of Title IV of Part Three of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council  ( 8 )  do not become applicable to credit institutions for own funds requirements purposes, investment firms should continue to apply the requirements set out in Title IV of Part Three of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for the purpose of calculating K‐NPR. Alternatively, the own funds requirement of investment firms trading financial instruments with positions that are subject to clearing may, subject to the approval of the competent authority and certain conditions, be equal to the amount of total margins required by their clearing member, multiplied by a fixed multiplier. The use of K‐CMG should be predicated primarily on an investment firm’s trading activity falling entirely or substantially under this approach. However, the investment firm’s competent authority may also allow the investment firm to make partial use of the K‐CMG approach, provided that this approach is used for all positions that are subject to clearing or margining and one of the three alternative methods for K‐NPR is applied to portfolios that are not subject to clearing. In order to ensure that the requirements are proportionate to the nature, scope and complexity of the activities of the investment firms and that they are readily accessible to the investment firms within this Regulation, any review that subsequently takes place concerning the application of the methods for calculating the K‐factors should include the appropriateness of continuing to align the calculation of K‐NPR with the rules for market risk for trading book positions in financial instruments, in foreign exchange, and in commodities in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 575/2013."

Since threats to the security of network and information systems can have different origins, Directive (EU) 2022/2555 applies an all-hazards approach that includes the resilience of network and information systems, as well as the physical components and environment of those systems. Given that the requirements laid down in Directive (EU) 2022/2555 in that regard are at least equivalent to the corresponding obligations laid down in this Directive, the obligations laid down in Article 11 and Chapters III, IV and VI of this Directive should not apply to entities belonging to the digital infrastructure sector in order to avoid duplication and unnecessary administrative burden. However, considering the importance of the services provided by entities belonging to the digital infrastructure sector to critical entities belonging to all other sectors, Member States should identify, based on the criteria and using the procedure provided for in this Directive, entities belonging to the digital infrastructure sector as critical entities. Consequently, the strategies, the Member State risk assessments and the support measures set out in Chapter II of this Directive should apply. Member States should be able to adopt or maintain provisions of national law to achieve a higher level of resilience for those critical entities, provided that those provisions are consistent with applicable Union law."

            "(85) The smooth and efficient functioning of the payment system depends on the user being able to rely on the payment service provider executing the payment transaction correctly and within the agreed time. Usually, the payment service provider is in a position to assess the risks involved in the payment transaction. It is the payment service provider that provides the payments system, makes arrangements to recall misplaced or wrongly allocated funds and decides in most cases on the intermediaries involved in the execution of a payment transaction. In view of all of those considerations, it is appropriate, except under abnormal and unforeseeable circumstances, to impose liability on the payment service provider in respect of the execution of a payment transaction accepted from the user, except in respect of acts and omissions by the payee’s payment service provider, who was selected solely by the payee. However, in order not to leave the payer unprotected in the unlikely circumstances that it is not clear that the payment amount was duly received by the payee’s payment service provider, the corresponding burden of proof should lie on the payer’s payment service provider. As a rule, it can be expected that the intermediary institution, usually a neutral body such as a central bank or a clearing house, that transfers the payment amount from the sending to the receiving payment service provider, will store the account data and will be able to provide the latter where necessary. Where the payment amount has been credited to the receiving payment service provider’s account, the payee should immediately have a claim against the payment service provider for credit to the account."

            "1.   The institution's net open position in each currency (including the reporting currency) and in gold shall be calculated as the sum of the following elements (positive or negative): (a) the net spot position (i.e. all asset items less all liability items, including accrued interest, in the currency in question or, for gold, the net spot position in gold); (b) the net forward position, which are all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid under forward exchange and gold transactions, including currency and gold futures and the principal on currency swaps not included in the spot position; (c) irrevocable guarantees and similar instruments that are certain to be called and likely to be irrecoverable; (d) the net delta, or delta-based, equivalent of the total book of foreign-currency and gold options; (e) the market value of other options. The delta used for purposes of point (d) shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying. The institution may include net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged if it does so consistently. The institution may break down net positions in composite currencies into the component currencies according to the quotas in force. 2.   Any positions which an institution has deliberately taken in order to hedge against the adverse effect of the exchange rate on its ratios in accordance with Article 92(1) may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, be excluded from the calculation of net open currency positions. Such positions shall be of a non-trading or structural nature and any variation of the terms of their exclusion, subject to separate permission by the competent authorities. The same treatment subject to the same conditions may be applied to positions which an institution has which relate to items that are already deducted in the calculation of own funds. 3.   An institution may use the net present value when calculating the net open position in each currency and in gold provided that the institution applies this approach consistently. 4.   Net short and long positions in each currency other than the reporting currency and the net long or short position in gold shall be converted at spot rates into the reporting currency. They shall then be summed separately to form the total of the net short positions and the total of the net long positions respectively. The higher of these two totals shall be the institution's overall net foreign-exchange position. 5.   Institutions shall adequately reflect other risks associated with options, apart from the delta risk, in the own funds requirements. 6.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards defining a range of methods to reflect in the own funds requirements other risks, apart from delta risk, in a manner proportionate to the scale and complexity of institutions' activities in options. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2013. Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph, competent authorities may continue to apply the existing national treatments, where the competent authorities have applied those treatments before 31 December 2013."

Institutions shall calculate this number at least weekly. 3.   The following risks shall be adequately captured by the model referred to in paragraph 1: (a) the cumulative risk arising from multiple defaults, including different ordering of defaults, in tranched products; (b) credit spread risk, including the gamma and cross-gamma effects; (c) volatility of implied correlations, including the cross effect between spreads and correlations; (d) basis risk, including both of the following: (i) the basis between the spread of an index and those of its constituent single names; (ii) the basis between the implied correlation of an index and that of bespoke portfolios; (e) recovery rate volatility, as it relates to the propensity for recovery rates to affect tranche prices; (f) to the extent the comprehensive risk measure incorporates benefits from dynamic hedging, the risk of hedge slippage and the potential costs of rebalancing such hedges; (g) any other material price risks of positions in the correlation trading portfolio. 4.   An institution shall use sufficient market data within the model referred to in paragraph 1 in order to ensure that it fully captures the salient risks of those exposures in its internal approach in accordance with the requirements set out in this Article. It shall be able to demonstrate to the competent authority through back testing or other appropriate means that its model can appropriately explain the historical price variation of those products. The institution shall have appropriate policies and procedures in place in order to separate the positions for which it holds permission to incorporate them in the own funds requirement in accordance with this Article from other positions for which it does not hold such permission. 5.   With regard to the portfolio of all the positions incorporated in the model referred to in paragraph 1, the institution shall regularly apply a set of specific, predetermined stress scenarios. Such stress scenarios shall examine the effects of stress to default rates, recovery rates, credit spreads, basis risk, correlations and other relevant risk factors on the correlation trading portfolio. The institution shall apply stress scenarios at least weekly and report at least quarterly to the competent authorities the results, including comparisons with the institution's own funds requirement in accordance with this Article. Any instances where the stress test results materially exceed the own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio shall be reported to the competent authorities in a timely manner. EBA shall issue guidelines on the application of stress scenarios for the correlation trading portfolio. 6.   The internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and may be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or portfolio."

The right to port the number should be attributed to the end-user who has the relevant (pre- or post-paid) contract with the provider. In order to facilitate a one-stop-shop enabling a seamless switching experience for end- users, the switching process should be led by the receiving provider of electronic communications to the public. National regulatory or, where relevant, other competent authorities should be able to prescribe the global process of the switching and of the porting of numbers, taking into account national provisions on contracts and technological developments. This should include, where available, a requirement for the porting to be completed though over-the-air provisioning, unless an end-user requests otherwise. Experience in certain Member States has shown that there is a risk of end-users being switched to another provider without having given their consent. While that is a matter that should primarily be addressed by law enforcement authorities, Member States should be able to impose such minimum proportionate measures regarding the switching process, including appropriate penalties, as are necessary to minimise such risks, and to ensure that end-users are protected throughout the switching process without making the process less attractive for them.

Significant areas of the payments market, in particular card, internet and mobile payments, remain fragmented along national borders. Many innovative payment products or services do not fall, entirely or in large part, within the scope of Directive 2007/64/EC. Furthermore, the scope of Directive 2007/64/EC and, in particular, the elements excluded from its scope, such as certain payment-related activities, has proved in some cases to be too ambiguous, too general or simply outdated, taking into account market developments. This has resulted in legal uncertainty, potential security risks in the payment chain and a lack of consumer protection in certain areas. It has proven difficult for payment service providers to launch innovative, safe and easy-to-use digital payment services and to provide consumers and retailers with effective, convenient and secure payment methods in the Union. In that context, there is a large positive potential which needs to be more consistently explored."

            "(67) While this Directive recognises the relevance of payment institutions, credit institutions remain the principal gateway for consumers to obtain payment instruments. The issuing of a card-based payment instrument by a payment service provider, whether a credit institution or a payment institution, other than that servicing the account of the customer, would provide increased competition in the market and thus more choice and a better offer for consumers. Whilst today, most payments at the point of sale are card based, the current degree of innovation in the field of payments might lead to the rapid emergence of new payment channels in the forthcoming years. It is therefore appropriate that in its review of this Directive, the Commission gives particular consideration to those developments and to whether the scope of the provision on the confirmation on the availability of funds needs to be revised. For the payment service provider issuing the card based payment instrument, particularly debit cards, obtaining confirmation of availability of funds on the customer’s account from the account servicing payment service provider would enable the issuer to better manage and to reduce its credit risk. At the same time, that confirmation should not allow the account servicing payment service provider to block funds on the payer’s payment account."

            "(100) Institutions should hold a diversified buffer of liquid assets that they can use to cover liquidity needs in a short term liquidity stress. As it is not possible to know ex ante with certainty which specific assets within each asset class might be subject to shocks ex post, it is appropriate to promote a diversified and high-quality liquidity buffer consisting of different asset categories. A concentration of assets and overreliance on market liquidity creates systemic risk to the financial sector and should be avoided. A broad set of quality assets should therefore be taken into consideration during an initial observation period which will be used for the development of a definition of a liquidity coverage requirement. When making a uniform definition of liquid assets at least government bonds, and covered bonds traded on transparent markets with an ongoing turnover would be expected to be considered assets of extremely high liquidity and credit quality. It would also be appropriate that assets corresponding to Article 416(1)(a) to (c) should be included in the buffer without limitations. When institutions use the liquidity stock, they should put in place a plan to restore their holdings of liquid assets and competent authorities should ensure the adequacy of the plan and its implementation."

The definitions should exclude bilateral systems where an investment firm enters into every trade on own account, even as a riskless counterparty interposed between the buyer and seller. Regulated markets and MTFs should not be allowed to execute client orders against proprietary capital. The term ‘system’ encompasses all those markets that are composed of a set of rules and a trading platform as well as those that only function on the basis of a set of rules. Regulated markets and MTFs are not obliged to operate a ‘technical’ system for matching orders and should be able to operate other trading protocols including systems whereby users are able to trade against quotes they request from multiple providers. A market which is only composed of a set of rules that governs aspects related to membership, admission of instruments to trading, trading between members, reporting and, where applicable, transparency obligations is a regulated market or an MTF within the meaning of this Regulation and the transactions concluded under those rules are considered to be concluded under the systems of a regulated market or an MTF. The term ‘buying and selling interests’ is to be understood in a broad sense and includes orders, quotes and indications of interest. One of the important requirements concerns the obligation that the interests be brought together in the system by means of non-discretionary rules set by the system operator. That requirement means that they are brought together under the system’s rules or by means of the system’s protocols or internal operating procedures, including procedures embodied in computer software. The term ‘non-discretionary rules’ means rules that leave the regulated market or the market operator or investment firm operating an MTF with no discretion as to how interests may interact.

This phenomenon is, inter alia, caused by a lack of diversity in the composition of management bodies. To facilitate independent opinions and critical challenge, management bodies of institutions should therefore be sufficiently diverse as regards age, gender, geographical provenance and educational and professional background to present a variety of views and experiences. Gender balance is of particular importance to ensure adequate representation of population. In particular, institutions not meeting a threshold for representation of the underrepresented gender should take appropriate action as a matter of priority. Employee representation in management bodies could also, by adding a key perspective and genuine knowledge of the internal workings of institutions, be seen as a positive way of enhancing diversity. More diverse management bodies should more effectively monitor management and therefore contribute to improved risk oversight and resilience of institutions. Therefore, diversity should be one of the criteria for the composition of management bodies. Diversity should also be addressed in institutions' recruitment policy more generally. Such a policy should, for instance, encourage institutions to select candidates from shortlists including both genders."

Those differences stem from the overall complexity of the application of the framework to different investment firms based on the services that they provide, where some national authorities adjust or streamline such application in national law or practice. Given that the existing prudential framework does not address all the risks faced and posed by some types of investment firms, large capital add‐ons have been applied to certain investment firms in some Member States.

An institution shall use its internal model for determining the own funds requirements for the specific risk associated with traded debt positions and shall apply a 99 % confidence interval and a 10-day equivalent holding period. The internal model shall be used in such way that it simulates changes in the credit spreads of counterparties, but does not model the sensitivity of CVA to changes in other market factors, including changes in the value of the reference asset, commodity, currency or interest rate of a derivative. The own funds requirements for CVA risk for each counterparty shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula: where: t i = the time of the i-th revaluation, starting from t 0 =0; t T = the longest contractual maturity across the netting sets with the counterparty; s i = is the credit spread of the counterparty at tenor ti, used to calculate the CVA of the counterparty.

Where a counterparty instrument is not available, it shall be based on the proxy spread that is appropriate having regard to the rating, industry and region of the counterparty. The first factor within the sum represents an approximation of the market implied marginal probability of a default occurring between times t i-1  and t i ; EE i = the expected exposure to the counterparty at revaluation time ti, where exposures of different netting sets for such counterparty are added, and where the longest maturity of each netting set is given by the longest contractual maturity inside the netting set; An institution shall apply the treatment set out in paragraph 3 in the case of margined trading, if the institution uses the EPE measure referred to in point (a) or (b) of Article 285(1) for margined trades; D i = the default risk-free discount factor at time ti, where D 0  =1. 2.   When calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk for a counterparty, an institution shall base all inputs into its internal model for specific risk of debt instruments on the following formulae (whichever is appropriate): (a) where the model is based on full repricing, the formula in paragraph 1 shall be used directly; (b) where the model is based on credit spread sensitivities for specific tenors, an institution shall base each credit spread sensitivity (‧Regulatory CS01‧) on the following formula: For the final time bucket i=T, the corresponding formula is (c) where the model uses credit spread sensitivities to parallel shifts in credit spreads, an institution shall use the following formula: (d) where the model uses second-order sensitivities to shifts in credit spreads (spread gamma), the gammas shall be calculated based on the formula in paragraph 1. 3.   An institution using the EPE measure for collateralised OTC derivatives referred to in point (a) or (b) of Article 285(1) shall, when determining the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with paragraph 1, do both of the following: (a)"

            "(71) In the case of an unauthorised payment transaction, the payment service provider should immediately refund the amount of that transaction to the payer. However, where there is a high suspicion of an unauthorised transaction resulting from fraudulent behaviour by the payment service user and where that suspicion is based on objective grounds which are communicated to the relevant national authority, the payment service provider should be able to conduct, within a reasonable time, an investigation before refunding the payer. In order to protect the payer from any disadvantages, the credit value date of the refund should not be later than the date when the amount has been debited. In order to provide an incentive for the payment service user to notify, without undue delay, the payment service provider of any theft or loss of a payment instrument and thus to reduce the risk of unauthorised payment transactions, the user should be liable only for a very limited amount, unless the payment service user has acted fraudulently or with gross negligence. In that context, an amount of EUR 50 seems to be adequate in order to ensure a harmonised and high-level user protection within the Union. There should be no liability where the payer is not in a position to become aware of the loss, theft or misappropriation of the payment instrument. Moreover, once users have notified a payment service provider that their payment instrument may have been compromised, payment service users should not be required to cover any further losses stemming from unauthorised use of that instrument. This Directive should be without prejudice to payment service providers’ responsibility for technical security of their own products."

If information regarding the investment composition of the collective investment undertaking or exposure to the portfolio of assets is available, then the person discharging managerial responsibility or person closely associated with such a person shall make all reasonable efforts to avail themselves of that information.’; (b) in paragraph 7, the following subparagraph is inserted after the second subparagraph: ‘For the purposes of point (b), transactions executed in shares or debt instruments of an issuer or derivatives or other financial instruments linked thereto by managers of a collective investment undertaking in which the person discharging managerial responsibilities or a person closely associated with them has invested do not need to be notified where the manager of the collective investment undertaking operates with full discretion, which excludes the manager receiving any instructions or suggestions on portfolio composition directly or indirectly from investors in that collective investment undertaking.’. (2) Article 35 is amended as follows: (a) in paragraphs (2) and (3), the phrase ‘and Article 19(13) and (14)’ is replaced by ‘, Article 19(13) and (14) and Article 38’; (b) paragraph (5) is replaced by the following: ‘5.   A delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 6(5) or (6), Article 12(5), the third subparagraph of Article 17(2), Article 17(3), Article 19(13) or (14) or Article 38, shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of three months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object.

This amount shall reflect all applicable thresholds, minimum transfer amounts, independent amounts and initial margins under the margin agreement; (c) if the model captures the effects of margining when estimating EE, the institution may, subject to the permission of the competent authority, use the model's EE measure directly in the equation in Article 284(5).

The Commission Communication entitled \"Think Small First – Small Business Act for Europe\", adopted in June 2008 and revised in February 2011, recognises the central role played by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Union economy and aims to improve the overall approach to entrepreneurship and to anchor the \"think small first\" principle in policy-making from regulation to public service. The European Council of 24 and 25 March 2011 welcomed the Commission's intention to present the \"Single Market Act\" with measures creating growth and jobs, bringing tangible results to citizens and businesses. The Commission Communication entitled \"Single Market Act\", adopted in April 2011, proposes to simplify the Fourth Council Directive 78/660/EEC of 25 July 1978 based on Article 54(3)(g) of the Treaty on the annual accounts of certain types of companies  ( 3 )  and the Seventh Council Directive 83/349/EEC of 13 June 1983 based on the Article 54(3)(g) of the Treaty on consolidated accounts  ( 4 )  (the Accounting Directives) as regards financial information obligations and to reduce administrative burdens, in particular for SMEs. \"The Europe 2020 Strategy\" for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth aims to reduce administrative burdens and improve the business environment, in particular for SMEs, and to promote the internationalisation of SMEs. The European Council of 24 and 25 March 2011 also called for the overall regulatory burden, in particular for SMEs, to be reduced at both Union and national level and suggested measures to increase productivity, such as the removal of red tape and the improvement of the regulatory framework for SMEs."

For that purpose, Member States may require such providers to apply common tariffs, including geographic averaging, throughout the territory. In exceptional circumstances, in particular where the imposition of obligations under the second subparagraph of this paragraph on all providers would result in a demonstrated excessive administrative or financial burden for providers or the Member State, a Member State may, on an exceptional basis, decide to impose the obligation to offer those specific tariff options or packages only on designated undertakings. Article 86 shall apply to such designations mutatis mutandis. Where a Member State designates undertakings, it shall ensure that all consumers with a low-income or special social needs benefit from a choice of undertakings offering tariff options addressing their needs, unless ensuring such choice is impossible or would create an excessive additional organisational or financial burden. Member States shall ensure that consumers entitled to such tariff options or packages have a right to conclude a contract either with a provider of the services referred to in Article 84(1), or with an undertaking designated in accordance with this paragraph, and that their number remains available to them for an adequate period and unwarranted disconnection of the service is avoided. 3.   Member States shall ensure that undertakings which provide tariff options or packages to consumers with a low income or special social needs pursuant to paragraph 2 keep the national regulatory and other competent authorities informed of the details of such offers. National regulatory authorities in coordination with other competent authorities shall ensure that the conditions under which undertakings provide tariff options or packages pursuant to paragraph 2 are fully transparent and are published and applied in accordance with the principle of non-discrimination. National regulatory authorities in coordination with other competent authorities may require such tariff options or packages to be modified or withdrawn. 4.   Member States shall ensure, in light of national conditions, that support is provided, as appropriate, to consumers with disabilities, and that other specific measures are taken, where appropriate, with a view to ensuring that related terminal equipment, and specific equipment and specific services that enhance equivalent access, including where necessary total conversation services and relay services, are available and affordable. 5.   When applying this Article, Member States shall seek to minimise market distortions. 6.   Member States may extend the scope of application of this Article to end-users that are microenterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises and not-for-profit organisations."

        "question": "\"What are the steps that national regulatory authorities should take to ensure affordable internet access for consumers with low incomes?\" Answer Key: The steps involve monitoring services prices, setting up affordability measures, ensuring broadband internet access service and voice communication service availability at a fixed location, offering tariff options or packages to certain consumer groups, keeping national regulatory authorities informed of offer details, providing support for consumers with disabilities. Explanation: The question is asking for detailed understanding of the steps National Regulatory Authorities should take in order to ensure affordable internet access for low-income consumers, as stated in the given context paragraphs. This requires an understanding of each step, how they relate to each other and what their outcomes would be if followed correctly.",

The management body of an investment firm, regulated markets and data reporting services providers should at all times commit sufficient time and possess adequate collective knowledge, skills and experience to be able to understand the firm’s activities including the main risks. To avoid group thinking and facilitate independent opinions and critical challenge, management bodies should therefore be sufficiently diverse as regards age, gender, geographic provenance and educational and professional background to present a variety of views and experiences. Employee representation in management bodies could also, by adding a key perspective and genuine knowledge of the internal workings of firms, be seen as a positive way of enhancing diversity. Therefore, diversity should be one of the criteria for the composition of management bodies. Diversity should also be addressed in firms’ recruitment policy more generally. That policy should, for instance, encourage firms to select candidates from shortlists including both genders.

K‐ASA captures the risk of safeguarding and administering client assets, and ensures that investment firms hold capital in proportion to such balances, regardless of whether they are on its own balance sheet or in third‐party accounts.

K‐CMH excludes client money that is deposited on a (custodian) bank account in the name of the client itself, where the investment firm has access to the client money via a third‐party mandate.

To that end, institutions should be required to provide competent authorities with the results of internal models applied to EBA-developed benchmark portfolios covering a wide range of exposures. Based on the information received, competent authorities should take appropriate steps to ensure that similarities or differences in results for the same exposure are justifiable in terms of the risks incurred. More generally, the competent authorities and EBA should ensure that the choice between an internal modelling approach and a standardised approach does not result in the under-estimation of own funds requirements. While own funds requirements for operational risk are more difficult to allocate at individual exposure level and it is therefore appropriate to exclude this risk category from the benchmarking process, competent authorities should nevertheless keep abreast of developments in internal modelling approaches to operational risk, with the aim of monitoring the range of practices employed and improving supervisory approaches."

It shall consist of a specific summary based on Article 7, a specific registration document and a specific securities note. The information in the EU Growth prospectus shall be presented in a standardised sequence in accordance with the delegated act referred to in paragraph 2. 2.   The Commission shall, by 21 January 2019, adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 44 to supplement this Regulation by specifying the reduced content and the standardised format and sequence for the EU Growth prospectus, as well as the reduced content and the standardised format of the specific summary.

In doing so, the Commission shall take into account the following: (a) the need to ensure that the EU Growth prospectus is significantly lighter than the standard prospectus, in terms of administrative burdens and costs to issuers; (b) the need to facilitate access to capital markets for SMEs and minimise costs for SMEs while ensuring investor confidence in investing in such companies; (c) the various types of information relating to equity and non-equity securities needed by investors.

National regulatory authorities should be able to decide to maintain or not to impose regulated wholesale access prices on next-generation networks if sufficient competition safeguards are present. More specifically, to prevent excessive prices in markets where there are undertakings designated as having significant market power, pricing flexibility should be accompanied by additional safeguards to protect competition and end-user interests, such as strict non-discrimination obligations, measures to ensure technical and economic replicability of downstream products, and a demonstrable retail price constraint resulting from infrastructure competition or a price anchor stemming from other regulated access products, or both. Those competitive safeguards do not prejudice the identification by national regulatory authorities of other circumstances under which it would be appropriate not to impose regulated access prices for certain wholesale inputs, such as where high price elasticity of end-user demand makes it unprofitable for the undertaking designated as having significant market power to charge prices appreciably above the competitive level or where lower population density reduces the incentives for the development of very high capacity networks and the national regulatory authority establishes that effective and non-discriminatory access is ensured through obligations imposed in accordance with this Directive."

That trading obligation requires investment firms to undertake all trades including trades dealt on own account and trades dealt when executing client orders on a regulated market, an MTF, a systematic internaliser or an equivalent third-country trading venue. However an exclusion from that trading obligation should be provided if there is a legitimate reason. Those legitimate reasons are where trades are non-systematic, ad-hoc, irregular and infrequent, or are technical trades such as give-up trades which do not contribute to the price discovery process. Such an exclusion from that trading obligation should not be used to circumvent the restrictions introduced on the use of the reference price waiver and the negotiated price waiver or to operate a broker crossing network or other crossing system. The option for trades to be done on a systematic internaliser is without prejudice to the systematic internaliser regime laid down in this Regulation. The intention is that if the investment firm itself meets the relevant criteria laid down in this Regulation to be deemed a systematic internaliser in that particular share, the trade may be dealt in that way; however, if it is not deemed a systematic internaliser in that particular share, the investment firm should still be able to undertake the trade on another systematic internaliser where that complies with its best execution obligations and the option is available to it. In addition, in order to ensure that multilateral trading with respect to shares, depositary receipts, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), certificates and other similar financial instruments is properly regulated, an investment firm that operates an internal matching system on a multilateral basis should be authorised as an MTF. It should be clarified that the best execution provisions set out in Directive 2014/65/EU should be applied in such a manner as not to impede the trading obligations under this Regulation."

Serious cases of manipulation of interest rate benchmarks such as LIBOR and EURIBOR, as well as allegations that energy, oil and foreign exchange benchmarks have been manipulated, demonstrate that benchmarks can be subject to conflicts of interest. The use of discretion, and weak governance regimes, increase the vulnerability of benchmarks to manipulation.

However, in order to ensure fair competition between payment service providers, a participant in a designated payment system subject to the conditions of Directive 98/26/EC which provides services in relation to such a system to an authorised or registered payment service provider should also, when requested to do so, grant access to such services in an objective, proportionate and non-discriminatory manner to any other authorised or registered payment service provider.

In particular, high-frequency algorithmic trading may contain elements such as order initiation, generating, routing and execution which are determined by the system without human intervention for each individual trade or order, short time-frame for establishing and liquidating positions, high daily portfolio turnover, high order-to-trade ratio intraday and ending the trading day at or close to a flat position. High-frequency algorithmic trading is characterised, among others, by high message intra-day rates which constitute orders, quotes or cancellations. In determining what constitutes high message intra-day rates, the identity of the client ultimately behind the activity, the length of the observation period, the comparison with the overall market activity during that period and the relative concentration or fragmentation of activity should be taken into account. High-frequency algorithmic trading is typically done by the traders using their own capital to trade and rather than being a strategy in itself is usually the use of sophisticated technology to implement more traditional trading strategies such as market making or arbitrage."

The security, continuity and reliability of the type of digital services referred to in this Directive are of the essence for the smooth functioning of many businesses. A disruption of such a digital service could prevent the provision of other services which rely on it and could thus have an impact on key economic and societal activities in the Union. Such digital services might therefore be of crucial importance for the smooth functioning of businesses that depend on them and, moreover, for the participation of such businesses in the internal market and cross-border trade across the Union.

Competent authorities shall grant the permission referred to in preceding subparagraph only if the institution can estimate the effects of financial collateral on their exposures separately from other LGD-relevant aspects. The estimates produced by the institution shall be sufficiently suitable for reducing the exposure value for the purposes of compliance with the provisions of Article 395. Where an institution is permitted to use its own estimates of the effects of financial collateral, it shall do so on a basis consistent with the approach adopted in the calculation of the own funds requirements in accordance with this Regulation. Institutions permitted to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors for an exposure class under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3, which do not calculate the value of their exposures using the method referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, may use the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or the approach set out in Article 403(1)(b) for calculating the value of exposures. 3.   An institution that makes use of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or is permitted to use the method described in paragraph 2 of this Article in calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1) shall conduct periodic stress tests of their credit-risk concentrations, including in relation to the realisable value of any collateral taken. These periodic stress tests referred to in the first subparagraph shall address risks arising from potential changes in market conditions that could adversely impact the institutions' adequacy of own funds and risks arising from the realisation of collateral in stressed situations.

In the event that the periodic stress test indicates a lower realisable value of collateral taken than would be permitted to be taken into account while making use of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or the method described in paragraph 2 as appropriate, the value of collateral permitted to be recognised in calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1) shall be reduced accordingly. Institutions referred to in the first subparagraph shall include the following in their strategies to address concentration risk: (a) policies and procedures to address risks arising from maturity mismatches between exposures and any credit protection on those exposures; (b) policies and procedures in the event that a stress test indicates a lower realisable value of collateral than taken into account while making use of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or the method described in paragraph 2; (c) policies and procedures relating to concentration risk arising from the application of credit risk mitigation techniques, and in particular large indirect credit exposures, for example to a single issuer of securities taken as collateral."

            "(3) Network and information systems have developed into a central feature of everyday life with the speedy digital transformation and interconnectedness of society, including in cross-border exchanges. That development has led to an expansion of the cyber threat landscape, bringing about new challenges, which require adapted, coordinated and innovative responses in all Member States. The number, magnitude, sophistication, frequency and impact of incidents are increasing, and present a major threat to the functioning of network and information systems. As a result, incidents can impede the pursuit of economic activities in the internal market, generate financial loss, undermine user confidence and cause major damage to the Union’s economy and society. Cybersecurity preparedness and effectiveness are therefore now more essential than ever to the proper functioning of the internal market. Moreover, cybersecurity is a key enabler for many critical sectors to successfully embrace the digital transformation and to fully grasp the economic, social and sustainable benefits of digitalisation."

The lender pools and repackages a portfolio of its loans, and organises them into different risk categories for different investors, thus giving investors access to investments in loans and other exposures to which they normally would not have direct access.

The services of almost all essential and important entities are dependent on services provided over the internet. In order to ensure the smooth provision of services provided by essential and important entities, it is important that all providers of public electronic communications networks have appropriate cybersecurity risk-management measures in place and report significant incidents in relation thereto.

End-users, within the limits of their own internet subscription, should not be prevented from sharing access to their RLAN with others, in order to increase the number of available access points, in particular, in densely populated areas, maximise wireless data capacity through radio spectrum re-use and create a cost-effective complementary wireless broadband infrastructure accessible to other end-users.

Member States shall ensure that the management body monitors and periodically assesses the effectiveness of the institution's governance arrangements and takes appropriate steps to address any deficiencies. 2.   Member States shall ensure that institutions which are significant in terms of their size, internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities establish a nomination committee composed of members of the management body who do not perform any executive function in the institution concerned. The nomination committee shall: (a) identify and recommend, for the approval of the management body or for approval of the general meeting, candidates to fill management body vacancies, evaluate the balance of knowledge, skills, diversity and experience of the management body and prepare a description of the roles and capabilities for a particular appointment, and assess the time commitment expected.
